## 🪲 Debugging

### Enable File Logging
Logging to phone's local file system can be enabled/disabled from the Settings page. 
Logs are stored in the cache directory of the phone. 
For Android: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.librephotosmobile/cache/logs/`

You can also quickly send a bug report to the developer by shaking your phone.

**Note**: Since the app is in early development, logging is enabled by default on clean install.
